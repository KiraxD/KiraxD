## About Me

Hey! I'm Reshob, a tech enthusiast with a deep passion for **cybersecurity** and **ethical hacking**. My expertise lies in exploring network vulnerabilities and developing tools that can help identify and fix security flaws. I spend most of my time studying security protocols, writing Python scripts, and testing wireless networks for penetration points.

### My Interests:

- **Cybersecurity**: My primary focus is on ethical hacking and penetration testing. I enjoy understanding how systems are built so I can find weaknesses and propose solutions.
  
- **Wireless Penetration Testing**: I'm fascinated by wireless networks—especially how vulnerable they can be. From WiFi security protocols to advanced network manipulation, I enjoy breaking down the security of wireless networks in a controlled, ethical way.
  
- **WiFi Hacking**: Testing WiFi security is something I actively work on. From discovering vulnerabilities in WPA/WPA2 to performing **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks**, WiFi networks offer a unique challenge that I love to tackle.

- **Python Programming**: Python is my language of choice for building cybersecurity tools. It’s fast, flexible, and perfect for automating hacking techniques like network scanning, ARP spoofing, and packet sniffing.

- **Networking**: Beyond wireless penetration, I enjoy deep-diving into network protocols. I love understanding how data flows across networks and where the potential flaws might be in various security setups.

### What I Do for Fun:

- **Autism Advocacy**: When I'm not exploring the digital world, I am actively advocating for autism awareness and neurodiversity. It's important to me to help spread understanding and acceptance.
  
- **Building Tools**: I love creating custom tools for automating penetration tests, analyzing WiFi networks, and detecting vulnerabilities. Some of my tools focus on wireless exploitation, MITM attacks, and packet interception.
  
- **Staying Current**: I spend time reading the latest in cybersecurity news and trends, always staying on top of the newest vulnerabilities and tools in the infosec space.
